&lt;p&gt;The Active House key principles are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMFORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a building that provides an indoor climate that promotes health, comfort and sense of well-being&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a building that ensures good indoor air quality, adequate thermal climate and appropriate visual and acoustical comfort&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a building that at the same time encourages responsible environmental behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENERGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a building that is energy efficient and easy to operate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a building that substantially exceeds the statutory minimum in terms of energy efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a building that exploits a variety of energy sources integrated in the overall design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENVIRONMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a building that exerts the minimum impact on environmental and cultural resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a building that avoids ecological damage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a building that is constructed of materials with focus on reuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommended steps for Active House planning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the Commencement address delivered by Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple Computer and of Pixar Animation Studios, on June 12, 2005.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:ref&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first story is about connecting the dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.” My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned Coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second story is about love and loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down — that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world’s first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My third story is about death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I’m fine now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This objective tests the different strategies for reducing water use on a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you reduce landscape irrigation needs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drip irrigation minimizes the use of water and fertilizer by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone, through a network of valves, pipes, or tubing. Conventional irrigation has an irrigation efficiency of about 65%. Drip irrigation has an irrigation efficiency of 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single ‘deep’ watering for an extended period of time is much better than watering every day for a fraction of the time. Water the landscape during the coolest part of the day (generally in the morning), and avoid watering on windy days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weather- or sensor-based irrigation control technology uses local weather and landscape conditions to tailor irrigation schedules to actual conditions on the site or historical weather data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perform at least an annual water audit of how much water is being provided to different areas of the landscape in order to evaluate the needs of the area and to reduce water use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is rainwater harvesting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rainwater can be collected in cisterns, barrels, or storage tanks. This approach is called rainwater harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that using reclaimed rainwater limits the amount of rainwater flowing into the drains and into neighboring properties or streets. This helps with the rainwater management issues from the Sustainable Sites category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of water should be used for irrigation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Municipal water use for landscaping can be reduced if not eliminated by choosing alternative water sources. Both rainwater and graywater, considered non-potable, are excellent alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;indoor-water-use&quot;&gt;Indoor water use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You will hear about the types and quality of water repeatedly in LEED, because there are many synergies between the water credits and other credit categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an example of a waterless fixture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waterless urinal is one of those rare products that can save money and time while improving hygiene and protecting the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the flow rate of a standard shower?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.75 gpm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is graywater?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graywater is untreated household waste water which has not come into contact with toilet waste. Gray water is water that can be used twice. Graywater comprises 50-80% of residential wastewater. Graywater can come from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bathtubs, showers, bathroom sinks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;washing machines and laundry tubs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graywater does not include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;potable water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;waste water from kitchen sinks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;water from dishwashers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;waste water from toilets and urinals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is blackwater?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackwater is untreated wastewater from toilets and urinals. Blackwater cannot be used for irrigation and also does not have one standard definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should a site assessment occur?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A site assessment assesses site conditions before design to evaluate sustainable options and inform related decisions about site design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This exam objective covers all of the different impacts the design decisions will have once a site is selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What strategies will prevent construction activity pollution prevention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of valuable topsoil is one of the biggest environmental impacts of the site during the construction process. Prior to construction, there must be a plan to address construction activities and prevent erosion and sedimentation. Among the methods to limit erosion and sedimentation are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mulching&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Erosion control blankets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sediment (silt) fencing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Berms and constructed ponds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seeding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Straw bales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits of rainwater management?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce runoff. Cutting back on the quantity of rainwater entering a combined system results in a reduction in water that needs to be treated by already overburdened sewage treatment plants and reducing the energy that is used to treat sewage. Reducing rainwater runoff and filtering rainwater before it leaves the site can prevent sedimentation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce impervious surfaces. Permeable paving surfaces keep the pollutants in the soil or other material underlying the roadway, and allow water seepage to recharge groundwater while preventing stream erosion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reuse rainwater. Rainwater can be used for irrigation or processes inside the building. Innovative collection features can be made to look like pieces of art, and the water can be used for process water, toilet flushing water and more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low impact development. If rainwater must leave the site, the water should not run so quickly as to cause erosion of surrounding areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you reduce light pollution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good lighting design involves reducing three forms of light pollution: uplight, glare, and light trespass. The backlight, uplight, glare (BUG) method is used in LEED for light pollution reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatic light shut offs can ensure that lights are not left on after work hours or when they are not needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a heat island?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heat islands are temperature differences between developed and undeveloped areas.
The heat island effect is created when developed areas have higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. An urban heat island effect is caused by sunlight heating up dark colored surfaces such as roads and rooftops. Urban heat islands effects can also be created by narrows streets and tall buildings reducing the air flow through the city, as well as vehicle exhaust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urban heat islands refer to the elevated temperatures of up to 10 degrees in developed areas compared to more rural surroundings. Urban heat islands not only create discomfort, but they also contribute to smog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is SRI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solar reflectance index (SRI) is the most effective measure to determine how a roofing material will reject solar heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For non-roof materials such as vegetation, architectural shading devices, and materials that have more thermal mass but are less reflective, the solar reflectance (SR) measurement is used instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another energy use factor is emissivity. Emissivity measures how much heat or infrared radiation a material is able to shed back into the atmosphere. The emittance of a material refers to its ability to release absorbed heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of both solar reflectance and thermal emittance gives a more accurate and complete picture of a surfaces’ ability to reduce the energy consumption associated with air conditioning. The solar reflectance index (SRI) is a combined metric of these two factors. A general rule of thumb is the higher the number on a scale of 0 to 100, the better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="LEED" /><summary type="html">Site assessment Understand the importance of doing a site assessment.

  &lt;p&gt;This section has questions on the ‘why’ of green building&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the triple bottom line?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True sustainability has three key aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Economics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What design decisions would positively impact the social aspect of the triple bottom line?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brighter light bulbs create a better work environment for employees, and reduced pollution creates more breathable air in the surrounding communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do we need green buildings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green building is the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource efficient throughout a building’s life cycle. That life cycle respectfully analyzes and integrates site selection through design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction. The practice expands and also complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green buildings are specifically designed structures that reduce the overall negative impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment. High-performance green buildings address sustainable development throughout the building’s entire life cycle – from the beginning with the building’s site selection and design all the way through to the end of the building’s life. Sustainable buildings are significantly better than standard buildings. They use less energy, save money over time, provide better occupant health and comfort, and are better for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much energy do buildings use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, buildings account for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;36% of total energy use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;65% of electricity consumption&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30% of greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;code&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every project will have state and local codes that need to be followed. You don’t need to learn all the codes in your city. You do need to know that there are codes, and that local codes always take precedent over any LEED rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;values-of-sustainable-design&quot;&gt;Values of sustainable design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are hard costs, life cycle costs, and soft costs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hard costs&lt;/em&gt; deal with fixed assets. They are directly related to improving real property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soft costs&lt;/em&gt; are costs not directly related to building, construction, etc. These include architectural, legal, financing, engineering fees and other costs incurred before and after construction. These costs make construction possible but are not directly related to building the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life cycle cost (LCC)&lt;/em&gt; is the sum of all recurring and one-time (non-recurring) costs over the full life span or a specified period of a good, service, structure, or system. The life cycle cost includes the purchase price, installation cost, operating costs, maintenance and upgrade costs, and remaining (residual or salvage) value at the end of ownership or its useful life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of cost is the purchase of the site?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is life cycle costing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life-cycle costing (LCC) determines the cost of a product or system over its life time including payback periods, operational and maintenance costs, replacement, cost savings, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is life cycle assessment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a measurement of a product’s environmental impact throughout its life cycle, beginning with extraction through manufacturing, shipping, use, and then reuse or end of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does the cost of a green building differ than that of a conventional building?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green building projects have hard and soft costs just like traditional building, but the project team also considers life cycle costs. Green building also differs from traditional design by considering the operating and maintenance costs of the building over its lifetime, not just the construction costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regional-design&quot;&gt;Regional design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What climates are not good for a high reflectance roof?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold climates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In warm and sunny climates highly emissive roof products can help reduce the cooling load on the building by releasing the remaining heat absorbed from the sun. There is also evidence that low emissivity may benefit those buildings located in colder climates by retaining heat and reducing the heating load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are regional priority credits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional Priority acknowledges that different regions in the world have different needs and has selected existing credits in the rating systems that should be a priority. Regional Priority credits are listed by country, state and zip code. The intent of the regional priority credits and points is to encourage teams to attempt LEED credits that address specific environmental priorities in the project’s region. Teams can only earn up to 4 points in this category.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="LEED" /><summary type="html">Environmental impacts of the built environment This section has questions on the ‘why’ of green building What is the triple bottom line?
